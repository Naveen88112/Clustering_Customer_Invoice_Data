Customer Invoice Data Clustering

Overview
This project focuses on clustering customer invoice data using machine learning techniques. It aims to segment customers based on their spending behavior and transaction patterns to derive meaningful business insights.

Features
- Data Preprocessing: Standardization of invoice-related numerical features.
- Clustering Algorithms: K-Means and DBSCAN applied for segmentation.
- Performance Metrics: Silhouette Score used to evaluate clustering effectiveness.
- Visualization: Cluster insights represented using Matplotlib.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   
   "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-invoice-clustering.git"
   
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Upload the dataset (if required) and execute the cells step by step.

Results & Insights
- Customers were segmented based on invoice amounts and transaction patterns.
- K-Means and DBSCAN clustering methods were compared for effectiveness.
- Visualization helped understand customer behavior in different segments.
